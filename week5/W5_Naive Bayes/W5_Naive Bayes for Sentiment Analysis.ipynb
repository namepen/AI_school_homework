(xc had a really fresh story that made you reconsider where you stand morally).the combat in ffxv is sublime, the world feels as big as it is, but not too big, the main fights are not difficult enough to discourage you, but are wonderful spectacles. the list goes on. from the outset of watching brotherhood, i knew they were forging something special with these relationships. they even broke out of their respective tropes by the end. you get to see the genesis and evolution of each of them. what they say or don't say in some cases lets you in on the real information of who they are.\r when i finished the story, i immediately wanted more. i dove back in and am now 23+ hours into the after-game. i want to do everything i can. i want the best weapons. i want to explore everything. i want to do every side quest (they are better and more varied in this game than most). while i was playing through this game i felt like i was playing something enormously important. i still feel that way in the after game. i can't get enough. nothing besides the cup noodle ad took me out of it like all of these complaints i'm seeing. i went in with high expectations and somehow the game delivered to me and exceeded them. i really hope people try this for themselves and don't just take number reviews, because it is worth your time.\r thank you for reading.\n","\n","\n","man, the amount of people willing to outright lie about this game just to bash it is staggering. the psp games had equipment and a longer, more tedious story mode, and that is it. nobody really liked the forced board game, right? other than that nt’s actual battle system is outright objectively better than the originals. not to mention the stuff like battling summons as bosses, the variable different gauntlet modes, and having the core battle as a different type of gameplay entirely.\r assists obliterated 012's battle system, and made an already slow, safe, campy, spammy game even more painfully slow. brave to hp link attacks were objectively better in all regards to other hp attacks, and spamming them and hp attacks were the only way to play at high levels, since unless you outgeared your opponent (which is a really lame way to play) brave attacks were just too weak to matter. the chase system was awful, air dodges were far too strong, and ex mode was basically just given to whoever happened to be closest to the core when it randomly appeared. running away and endless dodging were common because there was no downside to it. guard was only a parry, so people would never use attacks that could get stuffed by it. and ex bursts were just long, drawn out free brave and hp damage, and were really just guaranteed finishers if the players were even slightly competent.\r now, hp attacks aren’t just better than brave attacks, and must be selected based on the player’s preferred playstyle. they are a commitment that dictates how one plays. brave attacks are far stronger and more varied, while also bring more balanced so there aren’t any that are outright useless compared to others. summons and the new cores are a bit overwhelming at first, but can be played around, and offer stage control first and foremost, rather than just using the best summon to get free brave like before. the cores must be attacked and defended from enemy attack, and summoning is a team effort that benefits the team. the game is focused around protecting allies, combining attacks with them for that amazingly satisfying feeling of comboing brave attacks to break and then an hp attack to seal the deal with your fellow players. blocking protects you from brave attacks on all sides and can give you a much needed escape from pressure. the new ex system makes everyone’s skill more unique instead of being a generic super mode, and gives you two attacks/buffs/debuffs that you can decide to take with you to fit how you want to help the team. and the best part of all this teamplay is that the final fantasy series has always been based on teamwork since the original game, and we finally see that in a competitive real time game.\r oh, and fyi, you can play 1v1 or 2v2.\n","\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"sT6g6eXACOkG","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let's print some negative reviews

made.\n","\n","\n","let me start off by saying, no game deserves 0 out of 10, if someone put effort into making a game it deserves at least a 1 even if effort is lacking.  this game is that lack of effort, i'm sure the story is pretty solid but i cannot get far enough into it before some experience ruining glitch occurs that brings me back to realizing this game isn't an immersive experience its a chore.  i consider myself very open to new ideas and am not quick to write off a game that isn't perfect at launch, but nearly 5 months after release the game still feels extremely clunky and unpolished even after all the updates they through into it.  and when i say clunky what i mean is frame rate drop, free running mechanics not working as their supposed to (worse than ac1 imo), a slew of graphical and rendering issues, and walking through npcs like they are phantoms.  i played up to sequence 6 before i said, i'll wait for the patch, so i waited for a few months and still not enjoying the game due to this unpolished product.  just going to look up a plot synopsis online because i can't take another minute of playing this very clunky and unfinished product.  hopefully ubisoft learns from this experience and doesn't release another sub-par game just to meet a deadline.\n","\n","\n","i pre-ordered the battlefront ii deluxe edition, having extensively played the beloved 2004 and 2005 originals and the 2015 battlefront remake. a feature of the deluxe model over the standard game permitted play prior to official release, and as a result i have spent the last 24-hours playing. however, buyer beware: this is not your atypical high-budget 'aaa' title; this game is better represented by a free-to-play mobile model.\r as a casual gamer, i have always been careful to avoid the free-to-play format which recovers revenue by tempting the player into purchasing in-game items and currencies via 'micro-transactions'. the in-game currency can then be used to buy 'loot-crates' which offer a chance to win more in-game items. the process can be repeated if the in-game item you want is not won immediately. slot machines work in much the same manner, wherein if you do not win a prize you can place another coin in the slot and try, try again. much to my dismay, this model has become popular with high-budget games such as overwatch and the recent call-of-duty, wherein cosmetic items (think costumes or 'skins', alternate paint-jobs on weapons, etc.) can be won by this gambling process. however, battlefront ii is distinct in that the items available for gamble are essential to the game-play itself (such as aim-assist, damage multipliers and powerful in-game characters).\r don't get me wrong though - the classic star wars backdrops and characters prominent in this game were visually impressive. furthermore, the gameplay itself appeared fluid and characters were well-integrated with environs, despite minor character clipping i noticed only toward the end of my last session with the game. however, after every death at the hands of an enemy character, a small window would pop-up on the screen to indicate the in-game items and and associated power-ups used to defeat me. despite in-game play timers placed on these upgrades before they can be used, many items persistent on my screen were clearly inaccessible at this pre-release stage of the game, except via micro-transactions. this constant visual reminder of in-game gambling largely nullifies any positive review i could provide about the graphical state of battlefront ii.\r ultimately, as an australian resident, i was able to return the game under the australian consumer law citing misleading conduct. it was unreasonable to expect that a full-priced game such as battlefront ii employ in-game gambling mechanics to the degree that it governs play. i would not recommend this game and, furthermore, hope that this review stands to support those who have purchased this game and feel similarly mislead.\n","\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"lLauB5BlCYPt","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We must add the labels: 1

a fan of the metal gear series, particularly 1, 2 and 3, this game has left me disappointed. why is that? first, it's an open world game. now mind you, i have nothing against open world games. open world games can be a blast if done right. since this is the first time metal gear has gone open world, i had high expectations that they'd not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. i mean, what is the point of making an open world game if it's not interesting to traverse? if you're not going to do that, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. and here is my first complaint with metal gear solid 5. the open world is uninteresting. you have africa and afghanistan. both overly brown, void of much life, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. while there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world, the side missions are, sadly enough, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. actually, they sort of detract from the game overall. instead of creating a linear, narrative-driven metal gear solid, they've created an open world, one that doesn't have anything interesting going on in it, and then try to throw in some copy & paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. but, then, the story must be good, especially if you're a metal gear fan, right? wrong. for whatever reason, konami replaced their old voice actors with new, more recognizable actors. for example, instead of david hayter, we get kiefer sutherland. not only does his performance fail in comparison to hayter's, he rarely even talks throughout the game. and here's another issue, there's barely any cutscenes compared to the prior metal gear's. while i'll concede that prior metal gear's may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes, but they've swung the pendulum so far from that that there's not enough now. i do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable, but when the world it takes place in, the narrative that surrounds, and the extra content is so poor, i can't give it praise that it simply doesn't deserve. if you're a fan of open world games, this will disappoint you. if you're a fan of metal gear solid's past, this will disappoint. as a fan of both, i'm floored that people are giving this game high marks. i can only surmise that it's because people were really hyped about it and now they're forgiving issues that they'll soon come to dislike. as is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn't all that years down the road. metal gear solid v is one such game.\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":169}]},{"metadata":{"id":"D-jOdvB_2NuE","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0},"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":4777},"outputId":"e0cb988e-6c5f-4f0a-8f57-5ab2a2c2d5c1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1529341343016,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":659,"user":{"displayName":"Eunji
